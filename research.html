      <h2>Research Projects</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Project 1: Development of new analgesic</li>
        <p>- Background: Pain management is a significant healthcare challenge, and there is a need for effective, safe, and affordable analgesics. Current analgesics have limitations, such as addiction potential, gastrointestinal side effects, or inadequate efficacy.
- Objective: To develop a new analgesic compound that is potent, safe, and has a favorable side effect profile.
- Research Plan:
    - Identify and synthesize novel lead compounds with analgesic activity
    - Evaluate the compounds' efficacy and safety in preclinical models
    - Optimize the lead compound's structure to improve potency and reduce toxicity
    - Conduct preclinical and clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy
- Expected Outcome: A new analgesic compound with improved efficacy and safety profile, addressing the unmet need for effective pain management.</p>
        <li>Project 2: Investigation of new antibiotic</li>
        <p>- Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health threat, and there is an urgent need for new antibiotics to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria.
- Objective: To discover and develop a new antibiotic compound effective against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
- Research Plan:
    - Screen natural products and synthetic compounds for antibacterial activity
    - Identify and optimize lead compounds with potent antibacterial activity
    - Evaluate the compounds' efficacy and safety in preclinical models
    - Conduct preclinical and clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy
- Expected Outcome: A new antibiotic compound with a novel mechanism of action, addressing the growing threat of AMR and providing a treatment option for infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p>
